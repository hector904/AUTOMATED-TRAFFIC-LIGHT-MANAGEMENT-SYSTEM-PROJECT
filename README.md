# AUTOMATED-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-PROJECT
This repository hosts the source code, schematics, and documentation for an Automated Traffic Light Management System using a Raspberry Pi 4, cameras with OpenCV/YOLOv5-nano, and LED-based traffic lights, it dynamically adjusts timings based on toy car simulations of vehicle density designed to optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and enhance road safety by dynamically controlling traffic signals based on real-time conditionsin Kampala. Features include a mobile app/SMS interface for congestion monitoring and cloud-based coordination for citywide optimization.
